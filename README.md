# Heart Stroke Prediction Using Machine Learning Techniques

 Developed a machine learning model for early detection of heart stroke risk factors.
Utilized a diverse dataset of medical records and clinical data to train predictive models. Employed various machine learning algorithms, 
including logistic regression, decision trees, and deep learning techniques. Achieved accurate prediction of heart stroke risk factors, allowing 
for timely preventive measures and improved patient care.

Skills Utilized: Machine Learning, Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, Python, Medical Data Analysis, Predictive Modeling, Model Evaluation,
 Healthcare Analytics

Impact: Enhanced healthcare outcomes by providing a tool for early detection and prevention of heart strokes. The project contributed to reducing the 
incidence of heart strokes and improving patient prognosis.# Heart-Disease-Prediction.
